# Notes
Literally my first project ever. The whole design process took ~2 weeks, coding only took a few days. During the researching I noticed a lot of websites had the same colour scheme thus me choosing the pink scheme. I also really love cats so I had to sneak a cat in. I also wanted it to be child friendly and very easy to navigate with the pictures. All text used was dummy text and all images and icons were open source.
